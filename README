A simple, lean Drupal mapping distribution.

To build this distribution:
    - download Drupal
    - place quickmaps in the 'profiles' directory
    - run './build.sh' from the quickmaps directory to create the codebase with drush make. 
    - install Drupal normally.

If you need to clean your build, try:
    - rm -rf modules/
    - git checkout modules # Resets modules/quickmap
    - ./build.sh
