A simple, lean Drupal mapping distribution.

To build this distribution, download Drupal and place quickmaps in the 
'profiles' directory. Run './build.sh' from the quickmaps directory to 
create the codebase with drush make. Then simply install Drupal normally.

If you need to clean your build, try:
    - rm -rf modules/
    - git checkout modules # Resets modules/quickmap
    - ./build.sh
